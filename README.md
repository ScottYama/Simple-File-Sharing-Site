This is a simple file sharing site that I created with a partner for CSSE330 - Rapid Prototype Development and Creative Programming. We created the site on an AWS instance using HTML, PHP, and CSS. Users must login with their username to access their secure files. From there, users can upload files, open files, delete files, and share files with other users. Also, if someone is new to the site, they can create a new username to start using the site.
